            <h1>The Sun</h1>
            <p> The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, nearly perfect sphere of hot
                plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core, radiating the energy from its
                surface mainly as visible light and infrared radiation with 10% at ultraviolet energies. It is by far
                the most important source of energy for life on Earth. The Sun has been an object of veneration in many
                cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical research since antiquity. <br><br>

                The Sun orbits the Galactic Center at a distance of 24,000 to 28,000 light-years. From Earth, it is 1 AU
                (1.496×108 km) or about 8 light-minutes away. Its diameter is about 1,391,400 km (864,600 mi), 109 times
                that of Earth. Its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, making up about 99.86% of the total mass
                of the Solar System. Roughly three-quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is
                mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon,
                and iron. <br><br>

                The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V), informally called a yellow dwarf, though its light is
                actually white. It formed approximately 4.6 billion[a] years ago from the gravitational collapse of
                matter within a region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, whereas
                the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. The central mass became so hot
                and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear fusion in its core. Every second, the Sun's core fuses
                about 600 billion kilograms (kg) of hydrogen into helium and converts 4 billion kg of matter into
                energy. <br><br>

                Far in the future, when hydrogen fusion in the Sun's core diminishes to the point where the Sun is no
                longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in density and temperature
                which will cause its outer layers to expand, eventually transforming the Sun into a red giant. This
                process will make the Sun large enough to render Earth uninhabitable approximately five billion years
                from the present. Subsequently, the Sun will shed its outer layers and become a dense type of cooling
                star (a white dwarf), and no longer produce energy by fusion, but it will still glow and give off heat
                from its previous fusion for trillions of years. After that, it is theorized to become a super dense
                black dwarf, giving off negligible energy.</p>

            <h1>The Moon</h1>
            <p> The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),
                about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have over time
                synchronized the Moon's orbital period (lunar month) with its rotation period (lunar day) at 29.5 Earth
                days, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth. The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a
                lesser extent, the Sun's – are the main drivers of Earth's tides. <br><br>

                In geophysical terms the Moon is a planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of
                the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as
                Australia.[17]) Within the Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in relation to its
                parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive moon overall, and larger and more massive than all
                known dwarf planets.[18] Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about half of that of Mars,
                and the second highest among all Solar System moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is
                differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere, atmosphere, or magnetic field. It
                formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact
                between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. <br><br>

                The lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains, impact craters, their ejecta,
                ray-like streaks and, mostly on the near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of
                cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into ancient impact basins. The Moon is,
                except when passing through Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the Sun, but
                from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its orbit, producing the lunar phases.[19] The Moon is
                the brightest celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its large angular diameter,
                while the reflectance of the lunar surface is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly
                the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun completely during a total solar eclipse. From
                Earth about 59% of the lunar surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective
                (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible. <br><br>

                The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge for humans, having been crucial to
                cosmography, mythology, religion, art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September 13,
                1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet
                Union's Luna 2 impactor. In 1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft landings
                and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969, humans for the first time landed on the Moon and
                any extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle of the United States' Apollo 11
                mission. Five more crews were sent between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The
                longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then, exploration of the Moon has continued
                robotically, and crewed missions are being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.</p>

            <h1>The Mercury</h1>
            <p> Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the Solar System. In English, it is named
                after the ancient Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of commerce and communication, and the messenger of
                the gods. Mercury is classified as a terrestrial planet, with roughly the same surface gravity as Mars.
                The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered, as a result of countless impact events that have accumulated
                over billions of years. Its largest crater, Caloris Planitia, has a diameter of 1,550 km (960 mi) and
                one-third the diameter of the planet (4,880 km or 3,030 mi). Similarly to the Earth's Moon, Mercury's
                surface displays an expansive rupes system generated from thrust faults and bright ray systems formed by
                impact event remnants. <br><br>

                Mercury's sidereal year (88.0 Earth days) and sidereal day (58.65 Earth days) are in a 3:2 ratio. This
                relationship is called spin–orbit resonance, and sidereal here means "relative to the stars".
                Consequently, one solar day (sunrise to sunrise) on Mercury lasts for around 176 Earth days: twice the
                planet's sidereal year. This means that one side of Mercury will remain in sunlight for one Mercurian
                year of 88 Earth days; while during the next orbit, that side will be in darkness all the time until the
                next sunrise after another 88 Earth days. <br><br>

                Combined with its high orbital eccentricity, the planet's surface has widely varying sunlight intensity
                and temperature, with the equatorial regions ranging from −170 °C (−270 °F) at night to 420 °C (790 °F)
                during sunlight. Due to the very small axial tilt, the planet's poles are permanently shadowed. This
                strongly suggests that water ice could be present in the craters. Above the planet's surface is an
                extremely tenuous exosphere and a faint magnetic field that is strong enough to deflect solar winds.
                Mercury has no natural satellite. <br><br>

                As of the early 2020s, many broad details of Mercury's geological history are still under investigation
                or pending data from space probes. Like other planets in the Solar System, Mercury was formed
                approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Its mantle is highly homogeneous, which suggests that Mercury had a
                magma ocean early in its history, like the Moon. According to current models, Mercury may have a solid
                silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper liquid core layer, and a solid inner
                core. There are many competing hypotheses about Mercury's origins and development, some of which
                incorporate collision with planetesimals and rock vaporization.</p>
