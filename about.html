            <h1>Kepler-7b</h1>
            <p>Kepler-7b is one of the first five exoplanets to be confirmed by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, and was
                confirmed in the first 33.5 days of Kepler's science operations.[2] It orbits a star slightly hotter and
                significantly larger than the Sun that is expected to soon reach the end of the main sequence.[2]
                Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter that is about half the mass of Jupiter, but is nearly 1.5 times its size; at
                the time of its discovery, Kepler-7b was the second most diffuse planet known, surpassed only by
                WASP-17b.[2] It orbits its host star every five days at a distance of approximately 0,06 AU (9.000.000
                km or 5.592.340 mi). Kepler-7b was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on
                January 4, 2010. It is the first extrasolar planet to have a crude map of cloud coverage.[7][8][9]
                <br><br>

                Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter, a Jupiter-like exoplanet orbiting close to its star. Its equilibrium
                temperature, due to its proximity to its star, is hot and is measured at nearly 1540 K. However, of the
                first five planets discovered by Kepler, it is the second coolest, being surpassed only by Kepler-6b.[4]
                This is over twelve times hotter than Jupiter.[4] Kepler-7b has a mass of only 0.433 that of Jupiter but
                due to proximity to its star the planet has expanded to a radius of 1.478 that of Jupiter. Because of
                this its mean density is only 0.166 g/cm3, about the same as expanded polystyrene. Only WASP-17b
                (0.49MJ; 1.66RJ)[10] was known to have a lower density at the time of Kepler-7b's discovery.[2] Such low
                densities are not predicted by current standard theories of planet formation.[11] <br><br>

                Kepler-7b orbits its host star every 4.8855 days at a distance of 0.06224 AU, making it the
                furthest-orbiting planet of the first five discovered by Kepler. Mercury, in contrast, orbits at a
                distance of 0.387 AU every 87.97 days.[12] In addition Kepler-7b has an observed orbital inclination of
                86.5ยบ, which means that its orbit is almost edge-on as seen from Earth.[4]Astronomers using data from
                NASA's Kepler and Spitzer space telescopes have created a cloud map of the planet. It is the first cloud
                map to be created beyond the Solar System. Kepler's visible-light observations of Kepler-7b's Moon-like
                phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere.[13] But
                these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or
                heat. The Spitzer Space Telescope played a crucial role in answering this question.[14]

            <h1>K2-18b</h1>
            <p>Kepler-7b is one of the first five exoplanets to be confirmed by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, and was
                confirmed in the first 33.5 days of Kepler's science operations.[2] It orbits a star slightly hotter and
                significantly larger than the Sun that is expected to soon reach the end of the main sequence.[2]
                Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter that is about half the mass of Jupiter, but is nearly 1.5 times its size; at
                the time of its discovery, Kepler-7b was the second most diffuse planet known, surpassed only by
                WASP-17b.[2] It orbits its host star every five days at a distance of approximately 0,06 AU (9.000.000
                km or 5.592.340 mi). Kepler-7b was announced at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society on
                January 4, 2010. It is the first extrasolar planet to have a crude map of cloud coverage.[7][8][9]
                <br><br>

                Kepler-7b is a hot Jupiter, a Jupiter-like exoplanet orbiting close to its star. Its equilibrium
                temperature, due to its proximity to its star, is hot and is measured at nearly 1540 K. However, of the
                first five planets discovered by Kepler, it is the second coolest, being surpassed only by Kepler-6b.[4]
                This is over twelve times hotter than Jupiter.[4] Kepler-7b has a mass of only 0.433 that of Jupiter but
                due to proximity to its star the planet has expanded to a radius of 1.478 that of Jupiter. Because of
                this its mean density is only 0.166 g/cm3, about the same as expanded polystyrene. Only WASP-17b
                (0.49MJ; 1.66RJ)[10] was known to have a lower density at the time of Kepler-7b's discovery.[2] Such low
                densities are not predicted by current standard theories of planet formation.[11] <br><br>

                Kepler-7b orbits its host star every 4.8855 days at a distance of 0.06224 AU, making it the
                furthest-orbiting planet of the first five discovered by Kepler. Mercury, in contrast, orbits at a
                distance of 0.387 AU every 87.97 days.[12] In addition Kepler-7b has an observed orbital inclination of
                86.5ยบ, which means that its orbit is almost edge-on as seen from Earth.[4]Astronomers using data from
                NASA's Kepler and Spitzer space telescopes have created a cloud map of the planet. It is the first cloud
                map to be created beyond the Solar System. Kepler's visible-light observations of Kepler-7b's Moon-like
                phases led to a rough map of the planet that showed a bright spot on its western hemisphere.[13] But
                these data were not enough on their own to decipher whether the bright spot was coming from clouds or
                heat. The Spitzer Space Telescope played a crucial role in answering this question.[14]
